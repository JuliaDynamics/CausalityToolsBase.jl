# Changelog

## Release v0.6.0

- Julia version >= 1.1 is required for releases >= 0.6.0.
- Changed type name `CausalityEstimatorParams` to `CausalityTest` because all tests are
completely specified by its parameters. This is the supertype for all causality tests in the CausalityTools.jl ecosystem.

## Release v0.5.0

- Add abstract type `CausalityEstimator` that will be the supertype of all causality estimator types in the CausalityTools.jl ecosystem.
- Add abstract type `CausalityEstimatorParams` that will be the supertype of all causality estimator parameter types in the CausalityTools.jl ecosystem.


## Release v0.4.2

### Improvements

- Updated docstrings for `Positions`.
- Updated docstrings for `TriangulationBinning`.


## Release v0.4.0

### Breaking changes

- All functions requiring a rectangular binning scheme now explicitly needs an instance of `RectangularBinning` (as opposed to inferring it from the numeric type, which could previously be done).

### Improvements

- Improved documentation for `RectangularBinning`.

## Release v0.3.5

- Improved documentation for `RectangularBinning`.

- Added a few more constructors for `RectangularBinning`.

    1. `RectangularBinning   (minmaxes::Vector{Tuple{Vararg{T, N}}}, n_intervals::Int` takes a vector of tuples indiciating the (min, max) along each axis and `n_intervals` that indicates how many intervals those ranges should be split into. 

    2. `RectangularBinning(minmaxes::Vector{<:AbstractRange{T}}, n_intervals::Int)` or `RectangularBinning(minmaxes::Vararg{<:AbstractRange{T}, N}; n_intervals::Int = 10)` does the same, but the arguments are provided as ranges and the number of intervals must be specified by keyword.

- Added `generate_gridpoints` function to explicitly generate the grid points used in methods relying on discretizations. Only valid for rectangular grids for now. The grid type is indicated by an instance of a `Interpolation.GridType`, which is either `OnCell()` or `OnGrid()`.

- Added extra `OnPoints<:GridType` type indicating that a set of points should be considered as the grid.

## Release v0.3.3

### New functionality

- Kernel density estimation (KDE) (`kerneldensity`).
- Mutual information estimation using KDE.

## Release v0.3.2

### New functionality 

- Support specifying axis minima/maxima for rectangular grid.

### Improvements

- Inputs to `customembed` are now validated.


## Release v0.3.1

### New functionality 

- Added `encode` method for `SVector` and `MVector`. 

## Release v0.3.0

### New functionality

- Do custom state space reconstructions with `customembed(pts, positions::Positions, lags::Lags)`. This function acts almost as `DynamicalSystems.reconstruct`, but allows for more flexibility in the ordering of dynamical variables and allows for negative lags. The `positions` variable indicates which dynamical variables are mapped to which variables in the final reconstruction, while `lags` indicates the lags for each of the embedding variables. Example: `customembed([rand(3) for i = 1:50], Positions(1, 2, 1, 3), Lags(0, 0, 1, -2)` gives a 4-dimensional embedding with state vectors `(x1(t), x2(t), x1(t + 1), x3(t - 2))`. Note: `customembed` expects an array of *states*. To embed a vector of time series, load `DynamicalSystems` and wrap the time series in a `Dataset` first, e.g. if `x = rand(100); y = rand(100)` are two time series, then `customembed(Dataset(x, y), Positions(1, 2, 2), Lags(0, 0, 1)` will create the embedding with state vectors `(x(t), y(t), y(t + 1))`. Pre-embedded points may be wrapped in a `CustomReconstruction` instance by simply calling `customembed(preembedded_pts)`.

## Release v0.2.0

A lightweight package providing functionality used throughout the `CausalityTools` ecosystem. 

### New functionality
- **Rectangular binnings**. 
    1. Bin-encode data points relative to some reference point, assuming a rectangular grid. Use `encode` for this.
    2. Determine joint and marginal bin visits given a set of points and a rectangular grid specification. Use `marginal_visits` and `joint_visits` for this.
    3. Compute the unordered histogram (visitation frequency) given a set of points and a rectangular grid specification. Extends `ChaosTools.non0hist` for custom rectangular grids (only cubes are allowed in `ChaosTools`). Can be used with the same  syntax as `marginal_visits`, 
    so that `non0hist(points, ϵ, dims)` will give the histogram over the visited bins of the rectangular grid specified by `ϵ`, considering the marginal
    along the given dimensions (`dims`).  

### Improvements

- Improved documentation for existing methods.

## Release v0.1.0

A lightweight package providing functionality used throughout the `CausalityTools` ecosystem.

### New functionality

- Wrappers for embedding dimension and lags from `DelayEmbeddings`.
- Abstract partition types.
- Abstract simplex intersection types.
